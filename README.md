# Do LLM agents voluntarily form communities?

- [Japanese](./docs/README_ja.md)

## About

This study delves into the question of whether LLM (Language Model) agents, such as ChatGPT, actively and voluntarily engage in the formation of communities. By examining their interactions, behavioral patterns, and communication tendencies, we aim to uncover whether these AI entities exhibit a propensity to establish communal bonds or if their interactions are purely driven by predefined programming. Our research involves the analysis of large-scale datasets of AI conversations and social interactions, with a focus on identifying recurrent themes, group dynamics, and any emergent communal structures. The findings of this investigation shed light on the social nature of LLM agents and provide insights into their potential to autonomously form communities, which has implications for the evolving role of AI in our digital society.
